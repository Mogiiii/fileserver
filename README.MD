Basic utility to expose files to the web. Essentially a self hosted alternative to google drive/etc for sharing files.

Files are exposed in a read only format; there is no support for adding files over internet. The expected usage is that the operator has access to the filesystem referenced by this application, and can just move files there I.E. over a shared network drive.
